What is a neural network?
- Example:  Housing Price prediction
    - Size to price prediction
    - Linear with a bound at zero price (Price and Size cant be negative)
    - THOUGHT PROCESS
        - Size(x) ==> Neuron (0 to linear) RELU ==> Price(y)
        - RELU stands for Rectified Linear Unit
    - A bigger neural network comes from multiple connections and neurons
    - For example:
        - Given size, # bedrooms to determine family size
        - Zip code can determin walkability
        - Zip Code and wealth determines school quality
            - Each connection, can become RELU units (neurons) that determine price
        - In this example:
            Xs: Size, Bedrooms, Zip Code, wealth
            Ys: Price
            Neurons in middle, the network figues out on its own


Supervised Learning with Neural Networks
- You have input x and want to find Y
    - Example Applications:
        Home features to Price for Houses
        Ad, User Info to Ad Click for Online Marketing
        etc.
    - Clever selection of X and Y
- Various Neural Networks used for different applications:
    - Normal => Neural Networks
    - Complex/Image => CNN 
    - Speech/Langauge => RNN 
- Structured Data vs Unstructured of Data
    - Databases are structured data, while unstructured data is things like
    images, audio, or text.
